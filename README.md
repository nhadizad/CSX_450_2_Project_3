# Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston #

## Domain ##
The problem is drawn from the study of the housing values in suburbs of Boston.

## Problem Statement ##
We will use supervised learning to develop a regression model that can predict the median value of an owner-occupied home, based on a number of features listed in the dataset section below.

## Dataset ##
The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.

The medv variable is the target variable.

This data frame contains the following columns:

    crim
    per capita crime rate by town.
    zn
    proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
    indus
    proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
    chas
    Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
    nox
    nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
    rm
    average number of rooms per dwelling.
    age
    proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
    dis
    weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
    rad
    index of accessibility to radial highways.
    tax
    full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
    ptratio
    pupil-teacher ratio by town.
    black
    1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
    lstat
    lower status of the population (percent).
    medv
    median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

## Solution ##

A solution to this problem will be a regression model such as a linear regression, a decision tree regressor, or a support vector regressor.

## Benchmark Model ##

A good naive benchmark would be to use either the mean or the median of the value of owner-occupied home for the dataset.

## Performance Metric ##

We can measure the success of our model using the R2 metric, the Mean Absolute Error, or the Mean Squared Error.
